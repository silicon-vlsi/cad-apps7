Linux quick reference on some most used commands

- `$ chmod -R a+rX` : will recursively __append_ read/execute(rX) for all (a) ie. user/group/other directories (X) and append only read for files only. **NOTE** This will not change __dot_files.
- `$ tar -o ...` : -o option will overwrite the ownership to the one who is untaring right now.
